# 🐹 My Go Language Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Go (Golang) learning journey!

This repository is a collection of notes, code experiments, mini-projects, and reflections as I explore the Go programming language from the ground up. Whether you're also learning Go or just curious, feel free to browse around, fork, or contribute ideas.

## 📌 Why Go?

- Simple and clean syntax
- Great for systems programming and backend development
- Built-in concurrency with goroutines
- Fast compile times and performance
- Strong standard library
- Explore new experiences & coding languages

---

- `basics/` – Variables, functions, conditionals, loops
- `structs/` – Structs, receivers, embedding, interfaces
- `concurrency/` – Goroutines, channels, select
- `error-handling/` – Error types, panic, recover
- `mini-projects/` – Small tools or apps I build to reinforce concepts
- `notes/` – Quick references, learning summaries, useful patterns

No nested folders. Everything is up here, simple and flat — just like Go likes it.

## 🔄 Ongoing Mindset

> “Don’t just learn Go — *think* in Go.”  
Keep it fast, readable, and explicit. Favor simplicity over cleverness. Write code that speaks clearly.

## 🧠 Reflections

This repo is a sandbox, not a polished project. Expect some rough edges, experiments, and incremental learning.  
If you're also on the Go path, feel free to fork, comment, or just hang out.

Let’s Go. 🚀
